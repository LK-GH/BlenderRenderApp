# BlenderRenderApp
Application that assists in rendering Blender projects from the command line.

BlenderRender remembers all your configurations such as the Blender EXE path, Blender project file paths, and per-project command line arguments.

Once you have configured BlenderRender, you just need to click the Render button. BlenderRender will then take your configurations and execute a Blender render using the command line.
